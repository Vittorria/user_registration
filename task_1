Consider our application a social platform. Users can join the platform by filling registration form with the following fields:
username (unique, required)
full name (required)
email (unique, required)
password (required)
inviter (optional)

Users can receive bonuses by inviting other users to join the platform. The invited user can enter its inviter’s username, and the platform will reward the inviter.

Users can have one of the following roles
USER
PARTNER

Each account has a balance, which is set to 0 on registration. Whenever a USER invites another user it receives 10 units to its balance. PARTNER’s receive 50 units for each invitation. The application should keep a history of each transaction.

Endpoints:

POST /register - registers a new user

GET /user/:userId - returns details about user

GET /history/:userId - returns the balance history of a given user
response example :
{
	payload: [{
		amount: <amount received for referring a new user>,
		userId: <invited user’s ID>,
		nickname: <invited user’s nickname>
	}, … ]
}
